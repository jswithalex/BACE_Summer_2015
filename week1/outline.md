  + a little bit about me

**Course Structure:**

  + first 3 weeks - Javascript language
  + last 5 weeks - JS in web environment (HTML is important here)

**The Github Repository:**
  
  + Course Syllabus
  + Weekly folders containing assignments, in-class files, demonstrations, and more.
  
**HTML/CSS core concepts:**

  + HTML is a tree-like, nested structure
  + turning CSS styles off and on with JavaScript

####  Functions 

**A high-level view of a computer program:**

  + division of a problem into smaller problems
  + twitter analysis example: connect to server, perform search query, store data, apply algorithm to data, present results
  + each step in the twitter analysis should be a function
  + functions work well for this
  + all Javascript code happens in a function
  + functions are defined first and then executed in your program according to your code

## Variables

**The street-level view of a Javscript program:**

  + variables are names for storage locations
  + The Javascript engine does work behind the scenes so that, for example, you can conveniently get 20 back by referring to 'my_number';
  + variables are not the values they store
  + we create a storage location with this javascript code: `var my_name;`.  This is called a declaration.
  + we put a value in that storage location like this: `my_name = 'alex';`. This is called a assignment.
