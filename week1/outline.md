## Variables

What variables are, what they are not:
  
  + variables are names for storage locations
  + The Javascript engine does the work so that you can conveniently get 20 back by referring to 'my_number';
  + variables are not the values they store
  + we create a storage location with this javascript code: `var my_name;`
  + we put a value in that storage location like this: `var my_name = 'alex';`
