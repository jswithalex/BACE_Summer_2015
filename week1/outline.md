## Week 1 Outline


**Introductions:**

  + your name, anything you want to mention with regard to your programming/ web background, and what you hope to get out of this course
  + a little bit about me

**Course Structure:**

  + first 3 weeks - Javascript language
  + last 5 weeks - JS in web environment (HTML is important here)

**The Github Repository:**
  + https://github.com/jswithalex/BACE_Summer_2015/
  + Course Syllabus
  + Weekly folders containing assignments, in-class files, demonstrations, and more.
  
**HTML/CSS core concepts:**

  + HTML is a markup language that tells the browser which widgets to create
  + it is a tree-like structure, nested structure
  + CSS augments the HTML elements
  + We can turn styles off and on with JavaScript
  + We can hide and display elements

**Our Workflow:**

  + downloading course files: https://www.github.com/jswithalex
  + on-the-fly coding / viewing script results: Web Browser JavaScript Console
  + writing our script files: TextWrangler
  
####  Functions 

**A high-level view of a computer program:**

  + division of a problem into smaller problems
  + twitter analysis example: connect to server, perform search query, store data, apply algorithm to data, present results
  + each step in the twitter analysis should be a function
  + functions work well for this
  + all Javascript code happens in a function
  + functions are defined first and then executed in your program according to your code
  
# Exercises: 
  
  + Download course Zip file from https://github.com/jswithalex/BACE_Summer_2015/
  + open TextWrangler
  + open week 1 folder
  + click on 'exercises.html' so the web browser loads it
  + 

## Variables

**The street-level view of a Javscript program:**

  + variables are names for storage locations
  + The Javascript engine does work behind the scenes so that, for example, you can conveniently get 20 back by referring to 'my_number';
  + variables are not the values they store
  + we create a storage location with this javascript code: `var my_name;`.  This is called a declaration.
  + we put a value in that storage location like this: `my_name = 'alex';`. This is called a assignment.
