## Course Description:

**Start Date**: 6/11/2015

**End Date**: 7/30/2015

**Dates we skip**: tbd

**Time & Duration**: Thursdays, 7-9pm. 8 weeks


This class will teach you the fundamentals of JavaScript and help you develop the skills to build page widgets and add logic to your HTML and CSS webpages.  

The first three weeks will be focused on the JavaScript language.  The remaining five will focus on applying your JavaScript knowledge to the browser environment and learning to use the JQuery library.


## Pre-Requisites

+ The only hard pre-requisite for this course is familiarity with the internet and using a web browser.

+ With that said, you will need a working knowledge of HTML and CSS to get the most out of this course.  By week four, you should know how to put HTML elements on a page and apply basic styles with CSS.  If you don't know HTML and CSS at the start of the course, you can use the first three weeks to catch up, as we will be solely devoting our time to learning JavaScript then.  I recommend [Shay Howe's website] (http://learn.shayhowe.com) for a comprehensive and practical guide to HTML and CSS.

+ Suggestion: create a GitHub account and make a javascript repository to save your work easily on the web.
