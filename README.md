## Course Description:

This class will teach you the fundamentals of JavaScript and help you develop the skills to extend the functionality of websites built with HTML and CSS.  

The first three weeks will be focused on the JavaScript language.  The remaining five will focus on adapting our JavaScript knowledge to the browser environment as well as learning to use the JQuery library.


## Pre-requisites

+ The only hard pre-requisites for this course are familiarity with the internet and using a web browser.

+ With that said, you will need a working knowledge of HTML and CSS to get the most out of this course (i.e., you should know how to put HTML elements on a page and style them with CSS).  If you don't know HTML and CSS at the start of the course, make sure to use the first three weeks to catch up, as we will be solely devoting our time to learning JavaScript then.  I recommend [Shay Howe's website] (http://learn.shayhowe.com) for a comprehensive and practical guide to HTML and CSS.

+ Suggestion: create a GitHub account and make a javascript repository to save your work easily on the web.
