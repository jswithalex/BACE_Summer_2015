HTML/CSS core concepts:

  + HTML is a tree-like, nested structure
  + turning CSS styles off and on with JavaScript
  
## Functions 

The high-level view of a JavaScript program:

  + division of a problem into smaller problems
  + twitter analysis example: connect to server, perform search query, store data, apply algorithm to data
  + each step in the twitter analysis should be a function
  + functions work well for this
  + all Javascript code happens in a function
  + functions are defined and then called
  
## Variables

What variables are, what they are not:
  
  + Variables are names for storage locations
  + we create a storage location like this: `var my_name;`
  + we put a value in that storage location like this: `var my_name = 'alex';`
