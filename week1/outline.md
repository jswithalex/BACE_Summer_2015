####  Functions 

The high-level view of a JavaScript program:

  + division of a problem into smaller problems
  + twitter analysis example: connect to server, perform search query, store data, apply algorithm to data
  + each step in the twitter analysis should be a function
  + functions work well for this
  + all Javascript code happens in a function
  + functions are defined first and then executed in your program according to your code

## Variables

The street-level view of a Javscript program:

  + variables are names for storage locations
  + The Javascript engine does work behind the scenes so that, for example, you can conveniently get 20 back by referring to 'my_number';
  + variables are not the values they store
  + we create a storage location with this javascript code: `var my_name;`
  + we put a value in that storage location like this: `var my_name = 'alex';`
  + The first is called declaration
  + The second is called assignment
