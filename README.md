## Course Description:

This class will teach you the fundamentals of JavaScript and help you develop the skills to extend the functionality of your HTML and CSS.  

The first three weeks will be focused on the JavaScript language.  The remaining five will focus on adapting our JavaScript knowledge to the browser environment as well as learning to use the JQuery library.

## Tools and Workflow

Check out [this screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqBG35oWdlE&feature=youtu.be) for a run-through of the Tools we're going to use in this course.

+ A working knowledge of HTML and CSS (you should know how to put elements on a page and style them with CSS).  If you don't know HTML and CSS at the start of the course, you can use the first few weeks to catch up, as we will be solely devoting our time to learning JavaScript then.  I recommend [Shay Howe's website] (http://learn.shayhowe.com) for a comprehensive and practical guide to HTML/CSS.
+ (not strictly required, but highly recommended) A GitHub account to save your work easily on the web.
