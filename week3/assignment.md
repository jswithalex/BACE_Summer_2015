## Week 3 assignment (for start of week 4)

Write a function called `split_on_char` that takes two arguments, a string and a character to split on (this will also be a string, technicall).

For example, if I split 'elephant' on 'e', the function call would look like this:

````
split_on_char('elephant','e');
````
