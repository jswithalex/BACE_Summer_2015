## Week 3 assignment (for start of week 4)

Write a function called `split_on_char` that takes two arguments, a string and a character to split on.

For example, if I split 'elephant' on 'e', the function call would look like this:

````
var resulting_array = split_on_char('elephant','e');
````

The results would look like this

````

console.log(resulting_array);
['l','phant'];
````

*Note:*
If you're having trouble, try to think about the problem in some depth before you start coding it.  Don't just google it.  Run through it with a pen and some paper, then translate that into code. This will help you develop problem-solving skills, whereas Googling the solution will not.
